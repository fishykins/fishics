[![Minimum Supported Rust Version]][Rust 1.56]


This is a 2D physics engine, built upon the bevy ecs architecture. 

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are plenty of wonderful physics engines out there, and the bevy ecosystem includes a few of its own.
So why build a new one? 

Simply put, there are lots of feature-rich options out there, but feature-bare options are few and far between. I aim to provide an engine that
is so simple, even a child could use it. There will be no fancy-ness, nor will there be advanced features. The only thing you can expect is 
axis aligned rectangles, circles, maybe some rotated rectangles, lines, and the performance of a slightly above average donkey. It will do.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
As with most rust crates, this can be imported to a project using [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates). Follow the link for more infomation.


### Optional features
None. You have no options left to you at this point in time.
